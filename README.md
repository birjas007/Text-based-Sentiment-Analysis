# Emotion Classification in Texts using Scikit-learn 
Classifying short messages into five emotion categories. We will prepare our dataset (nltk and regular expressions) and vectorize words using TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) metric. Later we will use classifiers provided by scikit-learn and classify sentences into five emotion categories: joy, sadness, anger, fear, and neutral.
